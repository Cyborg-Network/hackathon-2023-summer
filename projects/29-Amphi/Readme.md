Project Initiation Date (Year-Month):2022.7 


## Project Overview

- Project Background/Rationale/Problem to be Solved (If there are additional attachments, please place them in the "docs" directory. Submit in English).

  - The language service industry faces three pain points: high costs for rare languages, high communication costs due to information asymmetry, and a lack of a reliable quality evaluation platform.

    - High cost of a rare language for customers, the translation should be a convenient service to improve globalization, no matter its rare language or English, on the contrary, the rare language is quite a high price, it could be 10 times more than the English translation.

    - High communication costs due to information asymmetry: Limited information resources for rare languages make it difficult to find suitable language service providers. Finding the right translators or service providers requires more time and effort since relevant information is not readily available. Additionally, language barriers and cultural differences between language service seekers and providers can further increase communication costs. 

    - Lack of a reliable quality evaluation platform: There is a lack of a credible and trustworthy platform for evaluating the quality of language services, making it challenging for users to accurately assess the service providers. While there are existing evaluation platforms, the data is free and mutable which reference value is questionable.

- Project Introduction
  
  - Amphi is a Web3 + AI language service marketplace that offers not only online translation services but also offline proxy services such as cross-border e-commerce, media translation, and international proxy consulting. We aim to make language services more convenient to get by leveraging cutting-edge technology to address the high costs and information asymmetry between translators and clients. Our platform serves as a one-stop Web3 language service marketplace, setting new standards in the language service industry and providing a seamless entry point for Web2 users to access Web3.


  - The traditional language service industry will have a turnover of **US$60.1 billion** in 2021 and is expected to reach US$82.2 billion by 2025 with a **compound annual growth rate of 8.1%**.
