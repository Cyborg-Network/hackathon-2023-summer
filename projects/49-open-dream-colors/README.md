## Open Dream Colors

A blockchain **education art** project that combines the realms of creativity and technology.

It serves as an interactive platform where individuals can explore and deepen their understanding of blockchain while expressing their visions through colors.  
Participants are encouraged to learn about the fundamentals of blockchain technology, its decentralized nature, and its potential applications. They can then contribute their dream color to a shared digital canvas, representing their aspirations and dreams within the blockchain space. Each color added is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability, thus fostering a collaborative and decentralized art experience.

Through this project, people not only gain knowledge about blockchain but also become active participants in a collective artistic endeavor.

The idea is to incorporate new people into the ecosystem with a different proposal that also provides them with cultural and artistic value.  

It will be used in Rococo for educational purposes.

I'll make 3 tutorials:  
1. [A beginner's guide to interacting with the App Art!](https://rtomas.hashnode.dev/how-to-use-the-open-dream-colors-art-app-with-your-own-wallet-and-ask-for-rocs)
2. The UI with next.js & useink library (before 10 July)
3. How to code on ink! and explain the Smart Contract from this project (before 10 July)

#disclaimer: This contract is for educational/art purposes only. It is not audited. Gas may not be optimized.

Items Completed During the Hackathon:  
UI in next.js with useink library (https://github.com/rtomas/openColors-web)
