#### Vane-Trust is a trust leverager tool for solo online retailers and businesses.

*Digital experience re-imagined*

## Vane story
Ever used an e-commerce platform to buy something?, I did once used a social media e-commerce( Instagram) and the experience was devastating. I was buying my first pc and the seller/retailer had me on the right spot to scam my funds. Never received the pc and lost communication.

This has been the experience to many people out there. In a digital era  we have to use this platforms but we are hesitating due to lack of control of our funds during the interactions and putting trust at stake.

During my web3 journey, I encountered a personal experience that left a profound impact. I was working on a project that required tokens for deployment into the main net. Unfortunately, there were no exchanges or dexes providing those tokens at the time. In my quest to secure the required tokens, I reached out to the community for assistance. Thankfully, someone offered to help, and I trusted them completely. I exchanged some other tokens with the promise that they would provide me with the needed tokens, and they fulfilled their commitment. 

However, the story took a disappointing turn when I required more tokens in larger quantities. I followed the same process, but this time, I never received the tokens, and the person responsible ceased all communication after receiving the payment. This disheartening experience shattered my trust and left me in a state of depression. I made a promise never to work on web3 again, fearing the risk of being scammed. Unfortunately, such occurrences are not uncommon and could undermine the potential of web3 if people lose faith and fall victim to scams.
