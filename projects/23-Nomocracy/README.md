## Project Intro

### Background

Web3 has developed for years, and has achieved huge success in the field of crypto token (e.t. btc, stable coins, DeFi). People began to exploit the challenging realm of Internet, intending to copy the success from asset area, but they met obstacles. Years past, the Web3 app is yet hard to use, with high threshold and low response rate. There are some underlying limitations to explain why couln't the mainstream Web3 tech stack solve the requirements of Internet application (see: [my talk on RustChinaConf 2023](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14X4y1p7De/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)) .

### A New Proposal - EightFish

We did much research on how to bring blockchain technologies to traditional Internet, and built the theory of [Open Data Application](https://medium.com/@daogangtang/the-road-to-open-web-b684879a5571). 

Based upon this theory, we built a new development framework: [EightFish](https://github.com/eightfish-org/eightfish). 

EightFish is a development framework (maybe the first one) for the Open Data Application (ODA), implementing the Open Data Application Model (ODAM). The theory of the ODA and ODAM is located [here](https://medium.com/@daogangtang/the-road-to-open-web-b684879a5571). In short description: EightFish powers ODAs, ODAs constitute the Open Web.

Concretely, EightFish is a framework to develop a decentralized application in Web2 development style.

Unlike the smart contract blockchain tech stack most DApps adopt, EightFish makes your own network, a sovereign network which doesn't rely on any other Web3 layers or services.

By some elaberate designs, EightFish reaches the experiences of Web2/Internet web development, but for the OpenWeb/Web3 decentralized application.

Internally, EightFish consists of **Substrate**, [Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/index), redis, postgres and other components.

NOTE: EightFish itself is not a service/platform/serverless, it is just a dev framework tool.

Some progresses of EightFish:

1. We have done the first grant from W3F. See [milestone II](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/842)
2. We have done the last round of interview of Substrate Builder Program

**EightFish is the THIRD way to develop decentralized app in the Substrate/Polkadot ecosystem**.

### GUTP + Discux

But EightFish is just a development framework, it needs something to verify itself. So we start a new project in this hackathon to test it. This new project is called GUTP - General User Text Persistence protocol.

GUTP is a decentralized protocol running on the Substrate network, built in EightFish framework.

And GUTP is merely a protocol network providing data service for other application. So consequently we build another project named Discux to connect to GUTP to provide Web service for end users.

Discux is a forum application with nearly the same UI/UX against to traditional Internet forum product such as Discuz/Discourse. Users can share their ideas and comments on this forum. It's a general decentralized forum based on Substrate and EightFish stack.

Discux has its own backend and frontend implementations.

### Commits

EightFish was started at the beginning of 2023, so we won't put it into the achievement of this hackathon. 

The GUTP and Discux were newly created projects for this hackathon.
