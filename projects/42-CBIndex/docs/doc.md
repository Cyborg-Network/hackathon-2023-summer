## Project Structure

The project CBIndex is composed of both parts to best serve the users. Ideally, users can use the App to build and manage their crypto index funds, analyze the market with index indicators and tools, learn and practice fund manangement or fund investment with the fund simulator, practice copy-investing with the copy-investing simulator, and then use the DApp to copy-investing or invest in crypto funds in the real market.

https://dapp.cbindex.finance/ is the demo of CBIndex DApp (fully built on blockchain), which has the copy-investing feature now. The mutual fund (active fund and index fund) investment feature will be added in the future.

https://app.cbindex.finance/ is CBIndex App (mainly built on centralized server), which has crypto index fund building and management feature, mutual fund (active fund and index fund) creation and investment simulator, copy-investing simulator, and various analysis tools for crypto investment.
